## 🚀 What's New

### 👆 Gesture & Swipe Engine
*   **Accuracy Fix (Hitbox Center)**: Updated mapping logic to use key hitbox center coordinates rather than visual bounds, resolving rightward touch offsets (misrecognitions like "just" registering as "jest").
*   **Performance Optimization**: Added dynamic threshold early-exit bounds to the L2 gesture matching loop, significantly reducing CPU usage by skipping poor candidates.

### 🛠️ Visual & Keyboard Settings
*   **Accent-colored direct deletion**: Added a direct delete button (trash bin icon) in the downloadable dictionary lists to allow quick deletion of other layout dictionaries.
*   **Separate Experimental Dictionaries**: Fixed a naming/path collision where installing a main dictionary caused the experimental version to show as installed.
*   **Missing Dictionary Toolbar Redirect**: Redirects missing dictionary button directly to settings rather than showing a placeholder.
*   **Reset Prediction Context**: Reset word prediction context to the beginning of the sentence on new lines.
*   **Backspace Emoji Grouping**: Prevented non-emoji symbols (e.g. mathematical operators, box drawings) from being grouped and deleted together under backspace.
*   **Custom Translation Target**: Added support for custom translation target language options.

### 📦 Build & Package Size
*   **Exclude English Assets**: Excluded all prepackaged English dictionary assets from the standard flavor APK builds to optimize package size.
